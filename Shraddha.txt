Instead Of Scanner Class for taking an input from User 
if we use BufferReader class then the execution becomes faster


    //protected members cannot be used from main method
    //to create protected members Object making is not required


constructor chaining :

when any constructor is called of Derived class(Child class) , firstly Parent Class Constructor will be called , this is called Constructor Chaining.

Abstract Class:

-must be declared with an abstract keyword.
> can have abstract and non abstract methods;
> cannot be instansiated
> It can have parametrized constructors ,default constructor are by default present ,no need to make and static methods also we can define .
> It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

//Static Methods and properties:
when we want to save memory and there is a common value allocated to any variable:
static can be used

//because static chejo ko memory ek hi bar allocate hoti hai
//and objects k lie memory bar bar create hoti hai


The main purpose of OOPS concept is to provide Systematic way of Programming.


Integer.MAX_VALUE
Integer.MAX_VALUE is a constant in the Integer class of java.lang package that specifies that stores the maximum possible value for any integer variable in Java. The actual value of this is
2^31-1 = 2147483647
Any integer variable cannot store any value beyond this limit. Upon doing so, the memory will overflow and the value will get negative.

Integer.MIN_VALUE
Integer.MIN_VALUE is a constant in the Integer class of java.lang package that specifies that stores the minimum possible value for any integer variable in Java. The actual value of this is
-2^31 = -2147483648
Any integer variable cannot store any value below this limit. Upon doing so, the memory will overflow and the value will get positive.
